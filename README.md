# PalMod
Palette-editing software for Capcom games.

LKG is simply a mirror of the oldest working versions of the code that I know of.  This is the "1.22" code.  There are a number of variants of 1.22: some binary hacks of it, and a couple recompiles.  In all cases I have folded every positive change I know of into the active branch.

PalMod is the active branch.  That's where I'm releasing binaries from.

PalMod2014 is my copy of the DrewDub PalMod GitHub branch.  It looks to be identical to the 1.22 / LKG branch.
