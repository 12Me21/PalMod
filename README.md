# PalMod
Palette-editing software for Capcom games.

LKG is simply a mirror of the oldest working versions of the code that I know of.  This is the "1.22" code.  This is confusing because people forgot to bump the version number after 1.22 came out.  1.22 thus can mean almost any version.

PalMod is the active branch right now, and is what I am calling "1.23" for now.

PalMod2014 is my copy of the DrewDub PalMod GitHub branch.  This is currently untouched vanilla code: my plan is to work on the PalMod 1.23 code and fix that up, and then apply relevant changes to the PalMod2014 source.
